MREDU
=====

A simple simulator of a system which implements map/reduce paradigm similarly to how Apache Hadoop does.
Its objective is to be used as an educational tool to learn how to code map/reduce algorithms without
need to install complex components.

Requirements
============
To use it you will need:

  * A Python3 interpreter and standard library. Right now we are no Python2 compatible.
  * Install required packages from PyPi:

    $> pip install -r requirements.txt

Examples
========
There are several examples of use of the simulator in the root directory.

  * example1: Does some calculations from a list of tuples.
  * example2: Calculates the histogram of the number of words per line in the file quijote.txt from data folder.
  * example3: The ubiquous word-count example written to run on the simulator and applied to the same quijote.txt file.
